<p>A random day in May, coming back from Milan after a fine Saturday out
hanging with some friends, I found my PC dead.
A month later, bought a new one from Amazon and had it delivered from
Amazon.it, I upgraded to W10 and downloaded Void Linux for dual booting
it. I dunno why but I downloaded a musl-built iso. Damn it!
It's cool and all but leads to lots of struggle, because of compatibility
issues seldom mentioned in musl faqs and guides... No telegram desktop,
unless you build the sources and its megabytes of dependencies...
Obviously anything but qt5 isn't in Void repos.</p>
<p>Enough introduction, first quirk in Musl: building a scraper suite
written in C, <a href="https://www.w3.org/Tools/HTML-XML-utils/">html-xml-utils</a>, <code>make</code> gives an error.
The compiler can't find <em>optreset</em>, part of GNU getopt but not present
neither in musl getopt nor in BSD getopt afaik.
The solution for this is
<code>#undef HAVE_GETOPT_OPTRESET</code>
into config.h for autotools autolib automake autostallman-based codebases,
after having run configure.</p>
