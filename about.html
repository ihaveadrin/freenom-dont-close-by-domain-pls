<h1>About</h1>
<p>Your casual encounter on the net.
Opened this blog to avoid being shut off a domain name.
Will post randomly about Italian politics and society, and about unix.
In English, for Italian people.</p>
<h1>Feedback and erratas</h1>
<p>Submit them to my attention by </p>
<p><code>echo -e 'c2VuZGluZyBhbiBlbWFpbCB0byBwZXJjb3J0ZXNpYUB0Znduby5nZi4gSSByZWFkIGVtYWlscyE=' | base64 -d</code></p>
<h1>About the domain name</h1>
<p>It's very long!
I happen to stumble upon base64 more often than i thought, the domain
comes from piping my name into base64, lol. Now, if you pipe the domain name 
to <code>base64 -d</code>, you end up with gibberish, that's because the whole base64 
output didn't fit in the freenom form...</p>
