<p>Goddamn, I tried really hard. I'm not wishing to have three hundred thousand 
boots on a 240G ssd disk. So... no more voidlinux musl. It's been fun but...
I'm tired, lol.
No telegram desktop. No soulseek. No servo snapshots (which are shit but 
still). No plan9port. No libtask. (I think the latest two are caused by some 
problem in the build scripts which should go with posix threads and not with 
ucontext and fail). No fun allowed.
Back to voidlinux with glibc, but I think that I'll work again with musl, 
either from travis machines or chrooting or with a VM...
Feels like home now. Steam doesn't work, it hangs on installing appwhatever.</p>
